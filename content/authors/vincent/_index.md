I am a rising senior majoring in Statistics at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. While studying at the U of I, I am also working as a Course Assistant (CA) in several Statistics classes including [STAT 400 - Statistics and Probability I](http://catalog.illinois.edu/courses-of-instruction/stat/) (the first core Statistics course) and [STAT 420 - Methods of Applied Statistics](http://catalog.illinois.edu/courses-of-instruction/stat/) (statistical modeling in R). I will be graduating this May 2020 and I am open to any career opportunities in the field of Data Science / Data Analytics.
