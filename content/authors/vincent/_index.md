I am a fresh college graduate focusing in Statistics at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. While studying at the U of I, I am also working as a Course Assistant (CA) in several Statistics classes including [STAT 400 - Statistics and Probability I](http://catalog.illinois.edu/courses-of-instruction/stat/) (the first core statistics course) and [STAT 420 - Methods of Applied Statistics](http://catalog.illinois.edu/courses-of-instruction/stat/) (statistical modeling in R). I am passionate about data and problem-solving with a particular interest in data analytics and machine learning technologies. Proficient in R and Data Analysis, skilled in Python and SQL. Seeking opportunities in the field of data analyst/data science. Feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or email at vo8@illinois.edu.
