I am originally from Indonesia...

* Most people: WUT? Where the heck is that? 
* Me: Have you ever heard about Bali?
* Most people: Oh yeah Bali. It is a gorgeous island indeed!
* Me: Yeah and Bali is a part of Indonesia...

Well I wrote down the exact dialogue that I had with most people that I met here in the United States. Whenever they asked me where I came from, I immediately said Indonesia and most of them did not know where it is. Just a FYI: Indonesia is the world's fourth most populated country even though it looked tiny in the world map.

Right now I am still a student at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). However, I am also a self-taught statistician. To cover up the lack of knowledge that I did not receive from lecture and study materials, I spend a little time to study from the Internet mostly from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Never underestimate the power of the internet! Everyone can find and study a lot of stuff through it. As evidence, I built this website mostly by going through the internet and of course I did not know anything about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Below is a list of expertise that I picked up through the Internet:

* Tableau
* SAS Programming
* SQL
* Python
* Time-series analysis


In my free time, I love spending time with my family and my dog. Thank you so much for reading.
